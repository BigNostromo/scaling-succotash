		<h2>The Nitty Gritty of the Matteur</h2>
		<h3>Lancelot himself</h3>
		<p>Lancelot is a knight of King Arthur. He returns from a quest to find the Holy Grail in which most of Arthur's forces have been devastated. He is disillusioned in his place in the world and, particularly, with regards to his affair with Guinevere, Arthur's wife and Lancelot's lover. Lancelot initially puts his service to God before Guinevere but quickly relents on this. He is drawn, however, to compete in a jousting tourney to defend his pride. This leaves him wounded and he is forced to recover in the woods, like a goblin.<br>During the initial stages of his return, Lancelot attempts to make amends with Mordred, who is a bastard. Mordred refuses this friendship because he is a bastard. Mordred then attempts to murder Lancelot because he is a bastard.</p>

		<h3>Reasons why Mordred is an arsehole:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>He is a moany prick</li>
			<li>He moans at Lancelot for wanting to shag Guinevere but he also wants to shag Guinevere (???)</li>
			<li>Cheats at chess</li>
			<li>Rubbish at jousting</li>
			<li>He is a bastard</li>
